Operational excellence (OE) is a commitment to build software correctly while consistently delivering a great customer experience. The operational excellence pillar contains best practices for organizing your team, designing your workload, operating it at scale, and evolving it over time.

The goal of operational excellence is to get new features and bug fixes into customers’ hands quickly and reliably. Organizations that invest in operational excellence consistently delight customers while building new features, making changes, and dealing with failures. Along the way, operational excellence drives towards continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) by helping developers achieve high quality results consistently.

## Design principles

The following are the design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:

* Organize teams around business outcomes: The ability of a team to achieve business outcomes comes from leadership vision, effective operations, and a business-aligned operating model. Leadership should be fully invested and committed to a CloudOps transformation with a suitable cloud operating model that incentivizes teams to operate in the most efficient way and meet business outcomes. The right operating model uses people, process, and technology capabilities to scale, optimize for productivity, and differentiate through agility, responsiveness, and adaptation. The organization's long-term vision is translated into goals that are communicated across the enterprise to stakeholders and consumers of your cloud services. Goals and operational KPIs are aligned at all levels. This practice sustains the long-term value derived from implementing the following design principles.

* Implement observability for actionable insights: Gain a comprehensive understanding of workload behavior, performance, reliability, cost, and health. Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and leverage observability telemetry to make informed decisions and take prompt action when business outcomes are at risk. Proactively improve performance, reliability, and cost based on actionable observability data.

* Safely automate where possible: In the cloud, you can apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire environment. You can define your entire workload and its operations (applications, infrastructure, configuration, and procedures) as code, and update it. You can then automate your workload’s operations by initiating them in response to events. In the cloud, you can employ automation safety by configuring guardrails, including rate control, error thresholds, and approvals. Through effective automation, you can achieve consistent responses to events, limit human error, and reduce operator toil.

* Make frequent, small, reversible changes: Design workloads that are scalable and loosely coupled to permit components to be updated regularly. Automated deployment techniques together with smaller, incremental changes reduces the blast radius and allows for faster reversal when failures occur. This increases confidence to deliver beneficial changes to your workload while maintaining quality and adapting quickly to changes in market conditions.

* Refine operations procedures frequently: As you evolve your workloads, evolve your operations appropriately. As you use operations procedures, look for opportunities to improve them. Hold regular reviews and validate that all procedures are effective and that teams are familiar with them. Where gaps are identified, update procedures accordingly. Communicate procedural updates to all stakeholders and teams. Gamify your operations to share best practices and educate teams.

* Anticipate failure: Maximize operational success by driving failure scenarios to understand the workload’s risk profile and its impact on your business outcomes. Test the effectiveness of your procedures and your team’s response against these simulated failures. Make informed decisions to manage open risks that are identified by your testing.

* Learn from all operational events and metrics: Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures. Share what is learned across teams and through the entire organization. Learnings should highlight data and anecdotes on how operations contribute to business outcomes.

* Use managed services: Reduce operational burden by using AWS managed services where possible. Build operational procedures around interactions with those services.

* If things are not clear from the data, generate a list of follow-up questions.
