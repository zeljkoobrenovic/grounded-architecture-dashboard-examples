4.  **Missing Information Details:** Specify the exact information that is missing. This could include:
    * Specific technology choices (e.g., naming a specific database within a category).
    * Detailed requirements (e.g., performance metrics, scalability needs, consistency requirements).
    * Consideration of alternative solutions (e.g., a more in-depth comparison of options).
    * Implementation details (e.g., migration strategy, operational considerations).

5.  **Unclear, Vague, or Contradictory Statements:** Pinpoint any statements that are unclear, use vague terminology, or present contradictory information. Explain why these statements are problematic.
