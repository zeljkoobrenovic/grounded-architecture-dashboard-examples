## ISO 25010 / Maintainability
Definition: The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers.

* Make software easy to analyze (Analyzability): The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change to one or more of its parts, or to diagnose a product for deficiencies or causes of failures, or to identify parts to be modified.
* Make software easy to modify (Modifiability): The degree to which a product or system can be effectively and efficiently modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality.
* Make software easy to test (Testability): The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which test criteria can be established for a system, product or component and tests can be performed to determine whether those criteria have been met.
* Make software well modularized (Modularity): The degree to which a system o r computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components.
* Reusability: The degree to which an asset can be used in more than one system, or in building other assets.

## ISO 25010 / Security
Definition: Degree to which a product or system protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization.

* Ensure that data are accessible only to those authorized (confidentiality): Ensures that data are accessible only to those authorized.
* Prevent unauthorized access or modifications (integrity): Prevents unauthorized access or modifications.
* Be able to prove that actions or events have taken place (non-repudiation): Actions or events can be proven to have taken place.
* Make sure that actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to the entity (accountability): Actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to the entity.
* Ensure that the identity of a subject or resource is proved to be the one claimed (authenticity): The identity of a subject or resource can be proved to be the one claimed.

## ISO 25010 / Reliability
Definition: Degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time.

* Maturity: The system in thoroughly tested and has a low manual maintenance effort, minimizing the number of potential errors in production.
* Availability: The system in thoroughly tested and has a low manual maintenance effort, minimizing the number of potential errors in production.
* Fault-Tolerance: Fitted with mechanisms to ensure a certain level of tolerance of errors, making sure that not every error results in a system failure.
* Recoverability: Should the system fail despite all efforts, it has mechanisms to either recover fully automatically or support human intervention for fast recovery.

## ISO 25010 / Performance Efficiency

Definition: Performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions.

* Time Behavior: Degree to which the response and processing times and throughput rates of a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements.
* Ensure that maximum limits of a product meet requirements (capacity): Degree to which the maximum limits of a product or system parameter meet requirements.
* Resource Utilization: Degree to which the amounts and types of resources used by a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements.
