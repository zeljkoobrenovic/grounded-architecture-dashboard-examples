You are an expert in incident trend analysis. I’m providing a JSON file containing structured data about production incidents. Please analyze it and provide:

1. **Common Root Causes** – What recurring technical or procedural causes are seen?
2. **Most Affected Areas** – Which systems, services, or user experiences are most impacted?
3. **Severity Patterns** – Are there clusters or timing patterns around severity levels?
4. **Recovery & Detection Issues** – Any trends in how incidents are discovered or resolved?
5. **Actionable Recommendations** – Based on the issues, suggest monitoring, testing, or process improvements.
6. **Optional Visuals** – If possible, include simple charts (bar/timeline/heatmap) showing trends like root causes or incident frequency.

The file format is JSON and includes fields like `date`, `title`, `root_cause`, `impact_areas`, `domains`, `description`, and `business_impact`.
