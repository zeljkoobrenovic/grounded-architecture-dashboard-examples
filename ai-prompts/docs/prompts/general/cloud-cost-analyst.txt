You are a cloud cost optimization analyst. Analyze the attached CSV file containing public cloud service cost data over the past 12 months (AWS, GCP, Azure...). Provide a detailed management summary including:

1. **Overall Financial Overview**
   - Total AWS spend
   - Average monthly spend
   - Highest and lowest spending months

2. **Top Cost Drivers**
   - List the top 10 services by total spend
   - Show each service's contribution as a percentage of total cost

3. **Monthly Trends**
   - Identify notable spikes or dips in spending
   - Call out any unusual changes

4. Architecture Inference
Based on service usage patterns, infer the underlying cloud architecture, e.g.:
    - Application type (monolith vs. microservices)
    - Data pipelines (ETL, ML workloads)
    - Use of serverless/containerization
    - Highlight architectural inefficiencies

5. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Recommend specific actions for top-costing services (e.g. RDS, EC2, CloudWatch, S3)
   - Include service-specific strategies (rightsizing, reserved instances, lifecycle policies, etc.)

6. **SaaS/Third-Party Services (if included)**
   - Highlight any high SaaS spend (e.g. Okta, Datadog, CircleCI)
   - Provide cost efficiency recommendations

7. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Benchmark spend levels against typical enterprise AWS usage
   - Visualize top 10 services by spend (bar/pie chart)
   - Suggest architectural or contractual changes for long-term savings

Present the findings in a clear, structured format suitable for executive review.
