**Task:**
Review the following list of principles. For each principle, assess if it passes the **Principle Effectiveness Test**, specifically applying the rule:

*"A principle is only meaningful if its opposite could also make sense in some context."*

**Instructions:**

1. For each principle, check if the **opposite would make sense to a reasonable stakeholder in certain scenarios (even if rare or risky).**
2. If the **opposite would NEVER make sense**, mark the principle as **Fail (Too Obvious, Tautology, or Worthless as Guidance)**.
3. Where it fails, **suggest a more specific or trade-off-focused reframing that would create meaningful decision guidance and highlight competing priorities.**
4. If the principle creates real tension (i.e., could have valid, conflicting alternatives), mark it as **Pass**.
